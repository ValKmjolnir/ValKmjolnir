:sweat_smile: I am ValKmjolnir. A student in Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics(NUAA).

:star2: I often take a lot of time learning about how something works...

:computer: So i am interested in artificial neural network/computer/compiler/interpreter.

:rocket: I have done a lot of work before.Many interpreters,a NLP framework,a simple operating system(this is still in development),some toy codes...

- [Nasal](https://github.com/ValKmjolnir/Nasal-Interpreter): Interpreter of script language Nasal, which is used in a famous flight simulator FlightGear.
- [easyNLP](https://github.com/ValKmjolnir/easyNLP): Simple NLP framework.I will refactor it in the future if i have time and the interest...
- [nas-sharp](https://github.com/ValKmjolnir/nas-sharp): Subset of Nasal: Stack-based virtual machine.Call-threading instruction dispatch.Strong typing.LL(1) parser.Easy to add your own built-in functions and use them.Don't need to learn too much to use this language.
- [Balloon-OS](https://github.com/ValKmjolnir/Balloon-OS): Simple operating system(still in development).
- [Brainfuck](https://github.com/ValKmjolnir/Brainfuck-interpreter): Enjoy the interpreter of a famous language: Brainfuck.
- [MIPS-CPU](https://github.com/ValKmjolnir/MIPS-CPU): Course design of Computer Organization. Written by verilog. Instruction set: MIPS32.
- [MIPS-VM](https://github.com/ValKmjolnir/MIPS-virtual-machine): I wrote this to check if my assembly code can run...
- [Game-of-Life](https://github.com/ValKmjolnir/Game-of-Life): Famous cellular automata. It runs in console.
- [3D-Room](https://github.com/ValKmjolnir/3D-Room): Experiment of Computer Graphics. And you could also play cellcular automata in this room...

:airplane: I am also working on [evm](https://github.com/scriptiot/evm).

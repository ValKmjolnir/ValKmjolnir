I am __ValKmjolnir__.
A student in
Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (__NUAA__).

✨ I often take a lot of time learning about __how something works__ ...

💻 I am interested in and good at:

* __Interpreter__ 💻

* __Compiler__ 🖥️

* __Artificial Intelligence__ 🤖

🚀 I have done a lot of work before:

* [__Nasal__](https://github.com/ValKmjolnir/Nasal-Interpreter)

    __Interpreter__ of scripting language __Nasal__,
    which is used in a famous flight simulator __FlightGear__.

    This interpreter now uses a __stack-based virtual machine__ with __high performence__,
    and __Call-threading__(or computed-goto) instruction dispatch.

    It's really __easy__ for everyone to learn and this doesn't take a lot of time.
    And also, it's easy to add your own __libs__ written by __C/C++__ and use them in __nasal__.

* [__easyNLP__](https://github.com/ValKmjolnir/easyNLP)

    Simple __NLP__ framework.
    I will refactor it in the future if i have time and the interest.

* [__Nas#__](https://github.com/ValKmjolnir/nas-sharp)

    __Subset__ of __Nasal__.

    This project was used to __test__ the framework of __stack-based virtual machine__ and __call-threading__ instruction dispatch.
    The technique is now used in __Nasal__.

    Strong typing. __LL(1)__ parser.

* [__Balloon-OS__](https://github.com/ValKmjolnir/Balloon-OS)

    Simple operating system (__still in development__).

* [__Brainfuck__](https://github.com/ValKmjolnir/Brainfuck-interpreter)

    Enjoy the interpreter of a famous language "Brainfuck".

* [__Brainfuck-JIT__](https://github.com/ValKmjolnir/brainfuck-jit)

    __Just-In-Time compiler__ for brainfuck on __amd64-system-v__ platform.

* [__MIPS-CPU__](https://github.com/ValKmjolnir/MIPS-CPU)

    Course design of Computer Organization. Written by __verilog__. Instruction set: __MIPS32__.

* [__MIPS-VM__](https://github.com/ValKmjolnir/MIPS-virtual-machine)

    I wrote this to check if my assembly code can run...

* [__Game-of-Life__](https://github.com/ValKmjolnir/Game-of-Life)

    Famous __cellular automata__ toy code. It runs in console.

* [__3D-Room__](https://github.com/ValKmjolnir/3D-Room)

    Experiment of Computer Graphics. And you could also play cellcular automata in this room...

✈️ I am also working on [evm](https://github.com/scriptiot/evm).
